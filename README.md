To implement this, we can use a smart contract that follows the non-fungible token (NFT) or multi-token standard, such as the `ERC-721` or `ERC-1155` standard.

The smart contract can have a function that allows liquidity providers to stake their LP tokens by calling the function and passing in the amount of tokens they want to stake. We can also have a mapping that stores the amount of tokens staked by each liquidity provider, keyed by the liquidity provider's address.

To implement the time period requirement, we can have a timestamp field in the mapping that stores the time at which each liquidity provider staked their tokens. When a liquidity provider calls the function to claim their badge, we can check the current time and the timestamp field to determine how long the tokens have been staked. If the time period has passed, we can award the liquidity provider with a badge.

To implement the different badge levels, we can have a field in the mapping that stores the badge level of each liquidity provider. When a liquidity provider claims their badge, we can check their badge level and award them the next badge level. We can also have a function that allows liquidity providers to forfeit their lower-level badges in order to claim the next badge level.

We can also implement the requirement that the badge should follow the NFT or multi-token standard by using a contract that follows one of these standards and creating an instance of the badge as an NFT or multi-token. This will allow us to assign a unique identifier to each badge and store metadata about the badge, such as its level.

To provide full test coverage for the `BadgeStaking` contract, you can write a suite of unit tests using a testing framework such as **Truffle**.

To deploy the contract to a testnet, you will need to have a testnet provider such as Ganache or Infura set up, and use a tool such as Truffle or Remix to deploy the contract to the testnet
